## Product Vision: VitaPulse

**Date:** February 26, 2026 **SDG Focus:** SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being 

### 1. Vision Statement

**VitaPulse** aims to revolutionize the university healthcare experience by replacing outdated manual processes with a high-efficiency, **Agile-driven** digital portal. Our goal is to ensure that no student’s academic success is hindered by inaccessible healthcare, directly supporting the mission of **SDG 3** to provide timely medical support.

### 2. Strategic Justification

The current university clinic system suffers from "unplanned outages" and "difficult maintenance" due to a lack of modern software engineering principles. **VitaPulse** addresses these failures by:

*  **Reducing Risk:** Identifying scheduling conflicts early through iterative development.


*  **Improving Quality:** Implementing standardized coding practices to ensure a reliable student interface.


*  **Managing Complexity:** Using a modular architecture to handle peak usage during flu seasons or exam periods.



### 3. Core Requirements Summary

*  **Functional (What it does):** Students can book, cancel, or reschedule appointments, and the system generates instant booking confirmations.


*  **Non-Functional (How it performs):** The system must respond within 3 seconds and ensure all student health data is securely stored.



### 4. Target Stakeholders

*  **Primary Users:** Students and university clinic staff.


*  **Supporting Stakeholders:** System administrators for deployment and UX/UI designers for usability.
