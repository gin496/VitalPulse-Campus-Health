# VitaPulse: SDG 3 University Health Solution

**Principles of Software Engineering (ITS 64604)**

## Project Overview

VitaPulse is a mobile-responsive web prototype designed to support **Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-Being**. Specifically, it addresses the challenge of long wait times and inefficient manual booking at university clinics.

## Team Members & Roles

* 
** 👑 Ahmed Faiaz [Student ID:0389505] - (Scrum Master & Lead Documentation):** Group Leader responsible for Trello management, Sprint Backlogs, and User Story refinement.


* 
**Member 2 (UI/UX Designer & Frontend):** Responsible for Figma wireframes and the frontend prototype interface.


* 
**Member 3 (Backend & System Architect):** Focuses on database logic (ERDs), system architecture, and API simulation.


* 
**Member 4 (QA & Testing Lead):** Responsible for the Test Plan, UAT feedback loops, and bug tracking in GitHub Issues.



## SDLC Progress Summary

* 
**Planning:** Defined Product Vision and prioritized a Product Backlog using the **MoSCoW technique**.


* 
**Analysis:** Requirements gathered via student surveys and modeled using **UML Use Case Diagrams**.


* 
**Design:** Iterative UI design in Figma, following a **Throwaway Prototyping** model to validate user flow.


* 
**Testing:** Conducted **Red-Green-Refactor** unit testing and gathered user feedback for the final iteration.

### **Project Description**

**VitaPulse** is an integrated health-management ecosystem specifically engineered to bridge the gap between students and university medical services. By applying **Agile methodologies**, we have moved away from traditional, rigid booking systems toward a flexible, responsive platform that evolves based on student feedback.

The system provides three core value propositions:

* 
**Seamless Appointment Scheduling:** Eliminates manual queues by allowing students to book, reschedule, or cancel clinic visits in real-time.


* 
**Digital Health Dashboard:** Offers a secure, centralized interface for students to monitor their medical history and upcoming appointments.


* 
**Proactive Well-Being Support:** Features an automated notification system that ensures students never miss a consultation, directly supporting **SDG 3's** mission of timely medical support.



Developed through a series of **Sprints**, MediSwift utilizes a **Throwaway Prototyping** model to validate UI/UX decisions before final implementation, ensuring the end product is both intuitive and highly efficient.
